# Shepherd Dogs Herding Simulation (GAMA)

This is an agent-based simulation project developed for my Master's degree in **Applied Geoinformatics**. The model simulates shepherd dogs herding sheep and investigates how the **number of dogs affects herding efficiency**. The simulation was built using the **GAMA Platform**, which is tailored for spatially explicit agent-based modeling.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Simulate interactions between shepherd dogs and sheep within a defined spatial environment  
- Measure how different numbers of dogs influence the **efficiency of herding** (measured in the time it takes to drive all sheep in the sheed)  
- Visualize and analyze patterns in animal movement and grouping behavior  

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **GAMA Platform** (agent-based modeling)  
- Spatial data and scenario-driven modeling  

## 📁 Project Structure

- `models/` – GAMA model files  
- `includes/` – Predefined spatial boundaries  
- `results/` – Simulation output  
- `.settings/` – GAMA-specific project configuration  

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the model:  
  
1. Download and install the [GAMA Platform](https://gama-platform.org).  
2. Clone or download this repository.  
3. Open the project in GAMA and run the main experiment.
